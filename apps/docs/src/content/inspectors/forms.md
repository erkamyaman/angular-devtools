# Forms

The Forms tab reads the forms of the running page, in development builds only. It covers Signal Forms, reactive forms and template-driven forms. Actions you run from the tab are sent back to the page and run there.

## What it shows

### Forms list

The sidebar lists each form with its label, its kind (**Signal Forms**, **Reactive** or **Template-driven**) and its error count. When the panel runs inside a page and other tabs report forms, check **All pages** to include them.

Select a form to see its status, whether it is dirty or touched, whether it was submitted or is submitting, and an **Error summary**.

### Fields view

Each field shows its value, status, touched and dirty state, and errors. Extra facts depend on the kind:

- **Signal Forms**: constraints (`min`, `max`, `minLength`, `maxLength`, `pattern`), a pending `debounce`, `submitting`, and disabled reasons.
- **Reactive and template-driven**: whether validators and async validators are attached, the value `reset()` goes back to, `updateOn`, and the bound `ControlValueAccessor`.

Filter by path, or with the **Invalid**, **Dirty**, **Touched**, **Disabled** and **Error not shown** chips. Hover a field to highlight its input in the page.

### Error sources

Each error says where it comes from:

| Label              | Meaning                                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| validator          | A validator on the control.                              |
| template attribute | A template attribute, such as `required` or `minlength`. |
| cross-field rule   | A rule on an ancestor, with the ancestor's path.         |
| async              | An async validator.                                      |
| parse              | The input could not parse the typed text.                |
| schema             | A Standard Schema, with the path it reported.            |
| server             | A server or submission error.                            |
| setErrors          | Code set the error with `setErrors()`.                   |

### Field details

Click a field to open its details. There you can set a value, **Focus**, **Touch** or **Revalidate** the field, or **Store as global**. That stores the form as `$form`, and the field as `$control`, in the page console.

### Timeline view

Recent changes, newest first, each tagged with its origin: user, code or devtools. Array items are tracked by identity, so moves show as moves. Async validation times show as **pending** tags.

Check **Record details** to add the calling code of each change, validator changes, and component renders per keystroke. It is off by default and applies to the whole page.

### Submit view

What submit will do, and why it might do nothing. It also shows what the form sends. **Copy test fixture** copies a fixture for your tests.

### Lint view

Form bugs and model-aware accessibility checks, each with a fix. For generic accessibility checks, run axe on the page.

### Actions bar

The actions bar works on the selected form:

- **Touch all**, **Revalidate** and **Focus first invalid**.
- **Pick field on page**: click a field in the app to select it. Esc cancels.
- **Snapshot** saves the form's values. **Restore s1**, **Restore s2** and so on put them back.
- **Reset** and **Submit**.

## Where the data comes from

<ngmd-card-grid columns="2">
  <ngmd-card icon="zap" title="Live page">
    The overlay finds the forms through Angular's debug API and pushes their state.
  </ngmd-card>
  <ngmd-card icon="file" title="Source scan">
    The server adds the file and line of each form and its rules.
  </ngmd-card>
</ngmd-card-grid>

### When the page reports

The overlay pushes the forms every 3 seconds, and shortly after each `input`, `change`, `focusout`, `submit` or `reset` event. Reactive and template-driven forms also report each change through `control.events`.

### Validators run only when needed

To tell where each error comes from, the devtools run the sync validators of reactive and template-driven fields themselves. They do this only for enabled leaf fields. The result is reused for up to 5 seconds while the value and the validators stay the same. With **Record details** on, they run on every report.

Async validators are never run by the devtools. The probe emits no form events, so it does not show up in the timeline.

<ngmd-callout type="warning" title="Validators with side effects">
  The devtools call your sync validators. A validator that logs, counts or changes state will see extra calls while the Forms tab is open.
</ngmd-callout>

## How to use it

### Find why a form is invalid

<ngmd-workflow>
  <ngmd-step title="Select the form">
    The error count in the sidebar shows which forms fail.
  </ngmd-step>
  <ngmd-step title="Filter to Invalid">
    Click the <strong>Invalid</strong> chip.
  </ngmd-step>
  <ngmd-step title="Read the source">
    Each error says which validator, attribute or rule set it.
  </ngmd-step>
  <ngmd-step title="Check what the user sees">
    Click <strong>Error not shown</strong> to find errors that have no visible message.
  </ngmd-step>
</ngmd-workflow>

### Find why submit does nothing

<ngmd-workflow>
  <ngmd-step title="Open Submit">
    It explains what submit will do.
  </ngmd-step>
  <ngmd-step title="Read the payload">
    Compare the value with what your API expects.
  </ngmd-step>
  <ngmd-step title="Copy a fixture">
    Click <strong>Copy test fixture</strong> to reproduce it in a test.
  </ngmd-step>
</ngmd-workflow>

### Test a form by hand

<ngmd-workflow>
  <ngmd-step title="Snapshot">
    Save the current values.
  </ngmd-step>
  <ngmd-step title="Change things">
    Type in the app, or set values from the field details.
  </ngmd-step>
  <ngmd-step title="Restore">
    Click <strong>Restore s1</strong>, then click again to confirm.
  </ngmd-step>
</ngmd-workflow>

You can also open a form from its component in the [Components tab](/inspectors/components).

## Agent tools

`form` is a form id like `Checkout.form@ab12`, or part of its label. `path` is a dotted field path, like `address.city`.

### Write tools

| Tool                      | What it does                                                                       |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ng-devtools:form-action` | Set, touch, revalidate, reset, submit, focus, snapshot, restore and more.          |
| `ng-devtools:fill-form`   | Fills several fields through the inputs, like a user would. Can submit afterwards. |

Agents can loop: inspect, act, `wait-for-form`, then `form-diff` from the marker they had. The `ng-devtools:forms` resource holds every form and recent changes. See [Tools](/agents/tools).

## Limits and gotchas

<ngmd-callout type="warning" title="Reset, submit and restore ask first">
  In the tab, the button turns into <strong>Confirm reset</strong>, <strong>Confirm submit</strong> or <strong>Confirm restore</strong>. Click again to run it. Agents pass <code>confirm: true</code> for the same actions, and for <code>fill-form</code> with <code>submit</code>.
</ngmd-callout>

<ngmd-callout type="info" title="Fields that are never written">
  Secret fields are never written. For Signal Forms, hidden, readonly and rule-disabled fields are skipped too. Disabled reactive fields are written only with <code>force</code>.
</ngmd-callout>

<ngmd-callout type="info" title="Snapshots">
  Up to 20 snapshots are kept. They are lost on reload. Restore fails when the form's shape has changed, and it keeps the current value of secret fields.
</ngmd-callout>

<ngmd-callout type="danger" title="Form values leave the page">
  Values are sent to the devtools server, shown in the tab and returned to agents. Password fields and fields with secret-looking names are replaced with <code>[redacted]</code>. See <a href="/security">Security</a> to mask or unmask a field.
</ngmd-callout>

## FAQ

<ngmd-accordion>
  <ngmd-accordion-item title="Why does the tab say no forms on this page?">
    The current tab has no form yet. Click <strong>Show forms from all pages</strong> to see forms from other tabs.
  </ngmd-accordion-item>
  <ngmd-accordion-item title="Why are there no callers in the timeline?">
    Callers are recorded only with <strong>Record details</strong> checked.
  </ngmd-accordion-item>
  <ngmd-accordion-item title="Does the tab change my form when I only look at it?">
    No. It reads state and runs sync validators without emitting events. Only the actions write.
  </ngmd-accordion-item>
</ngmd-accordion>
