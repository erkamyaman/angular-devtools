  Give your coding agent the same view of the app that you have. Routes, components, forms, stores and the live page, as MCP tools and resources.

# MCP server

The devtools expose their inspectors to coding agents as *MCP tools and resources. An agent can list your routes, read the live component tree, explain why a form is invalid, or navigate the app.

There are two ways to connect. Pick one based on the data your agent needs.

## Pick a transport

<ngmd-card-grid columns="2">
  <ngmd-card icon="terminal" title="stdio" cta="Source only">
    Your client starts <code>ng-devtools mcp</code> in the project folder. The server scans your source. No page ever connects to it.
  </ngmd-card>
  <ngmd-card icon="zap" title="HTTP" cta="Source and live page">
    Your client calls <code>/__devframes/__mcp</code> on the server that runs your app. Pages open in a browser report to it, so the live tools work.
  </ngmd-card>
</ngmd-card-grid>

| Transport                   | Live page data                       | Setup                                |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| stdio (`ng-devtools mcp`)   | No. Source scan tools only.          | A command in your MCP client config. |
| HTTP (`/__devframes/__mcp`) | Yes, with the app open in a browser. | A URL on your app's dev server.      |

## Connect over stdio

The package ships an `ng-devtools` binary. Its `mcp` command starts an MCP server on stdin and stdout.

### Add the stdio server to your client

```bash group="stdio" name="Claude Code" active
claude mcp add ng-devtools -- npx @santoshyadavdev/ng-devtools mcp
```

```json group="stdio" name="Cursor"
// .cursor/mcp.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ng-devtools": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@santoshyadavdev/ng-devtools", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

```json group="stdio" name="VS Code"
// .vscode/mcp.json
{
  "servers": {
    "ng-devtools": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@santoshyadavdev/ng-devtools", "mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Start it in the project folder

The server scans the folder it starts in. Start it from the root of your Angular or Analog project, next to `package.json` and `angular.json`.

<ngmd-alert severity="helpful">
  Inside this repository, <code>pnpm devtools:mcp</code> runs the same server against the demo app.
</ngmd-alert>

### What stdio can answer

Over stdio, the source scan tools work: `get-routes`, `get-components`, `get-signals`, `get-providers`, `get-ngrx-store`, `get-pipes` and `build-meta`. So do the tools that read files only, like `lint-pipes`, `analog-routes` and `analog-lint`.

Tools that need the running app reply that no page is attached. Resources stay empty. Use HTTP for those.

## Connect over HTTP

When the devtools are embedded in your app's server, the same tools are served over HTTP. This endpoint sees the pages that connect to that server.

### Find your endpoint

The path depends on how you mount the devtools. Use the port your server actually runs on.

| Setup                                   | Endpoint                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| [Express hub](/getting-started/express) | `http://localhost:4000/__devframes/__mcp` |
| [Vite plugin](/getting-started/vite)    | `http://localhost:5173/__devframes/__mcp` |
| [Standalone CLI](/getting-started/cli)  | `http://localhost:9999/__mcp`             |

If you mount the devtools panel without the hub, at `/__ng-devtools/`, the endpoint is `/__ng-devtools/__mcp`.

### Send an Origin header

<ngmd-callout type="warning" title="Requests without an Origin header get 403">
  The HTTP endpoint only answers requests from this machine that carry a local <code>Origin</code> header, such as <code>http://localhost:4000</code>. Requests without one get <code>403 Forbidden</code>. If your MCP client does not send an <code>Origin</code> header, add it in the client config.
</ngmd-callout>

The header value is the origin of your dev server. Every example below sets it.

### Add the HTTP endpoint to your client

```bash group="http" name="Claude Code" active
claude mcp add --transport http ng-devtools http://localhost:4000/__devframes/__mcp \
  --header "Origin: http://localhost:4000"
```

```json group="http" name="Cursor"
// .cursor/mcp.json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ng-devtools": {
      "url": "http://localhost:4000/__devframes/__mcp",
      "headers": {"Origin": "http://localhost:4000"}
    }
  }
}
```

```json group="http" name="VS Code"
// .vscode/mcp.json
{
  "servers": {
    "ng-devtools": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "http://localhost:4000/__devframes/__mcp",
      "headers": {"Origin": "http://localhost:4000"}
    }
  }
}
```

### Open the app in a browser

The live tools read what the page reports. Without an open page, they have nothing to answer with.

<ngmd-workflow>
  <ngmd-step title="Start your app">
    Run the server that mounts the devtools: your Express SSR server, the Vite dev server, or <code>ng-devtools dev</code>.
  </ngmd-step>
  <ngmd-step title="Open it in a browser">
    Load the app with the <a href="/getting-started/overlay">overlay</a>. The page connects to the devtools and starts reporting.
  </ngmd-step>
  <ngmd-step title="Call a tool">
    Ask your agent something the page knows, like "why is the checkout form invalid?". It calls <code>explain-form-invalid</code> on the connected page.
  </ngmd-step>
</ngmd-workflow>

## How tools behave

### Tool names

Tools are registered with a colon, as `ng-devtools:get-routes`. MCP clients see them with an underscore, as `ng-devtools_get-routes`. Calls with either form work.

### Read and action tools

Read-only tools are marked read-only for your client. Five tools act on the app, so they are not:

<ngmd-pill-row>
  <ngmd-pill href="/agents/tools#components-signals-and-di" title="highlight"></ngmd-pill>
  <ngmd-pill href="/agents/tools#act-on-the-router" title="navigate"></ngmd-pill>
  <ngmd-pill href="/agents/tools#act-on-a-form" title="form-action"></ngmd-pill>
  <ngmd-pill href="/agents/tools#act-on-a-form" title="fill-form"></ngmd-pill>
  <ngmd-pill href="/agents/tools#call-a-server-route" title="analog-call-api"></ngmd-pill>
</ngmd-pill-row>

Your client can ask you before it runs them.

### Pages and tabs

Each browser tab reports on its own and gets a page id. Tools that read live data use the most recent page by default. Pass `page` (or `pageId` for `inspect-providers`) to pick another tab. Pages that stop reporting are dropped after a short time.
