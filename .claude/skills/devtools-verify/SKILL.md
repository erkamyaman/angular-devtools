# Verify a change

## 1. The CI checks

Run them in this order; all must pass:

```sh
pnpm format:check
pnpm commit:check
pnpm skills:check
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm test:devtools
pnpm build
pnpm extension:build
pnpm devtools:build-pkg
git status --porcelain -- extension/ui   # must be committed when app/ changed
```

CI runs `pnpm exec nx affected -t test build` instead of the plain `pnpm test` and `pnpm build`; run it too when your change touches more than one project.

When the change touches the docs site (apps/docs) or `README.md`, also run the build checks in the `devtools-docs` skill.

`pnpm typecheck` does not type-check panel templates. Also run:

```sh
NO_COLOR=1 pnpm exec ngc -p app/tsconfig.json --noEmit
```

and treat any `error TS` or `error NG` line as a failure. Strip color codes before grepping the output, or errors slip through.

## 2. Run the demos

`pnpm build` is a production build and turns the in-page launcher off. For manual checks rebuild in development mode:

```sh
pnpm build --configuration development
node dist/angular-devtools/server/server.mjs   # Angular Travel on :4000
pnpm analog:dev                                 # Analog demo on :5173
```

Open the panel through the amber launcher on the page, at `/__devframes/`, and directly at `/__devframes/ng-devtools/?view=angular#tab=<tab>`.

## 3. Browser checks

With Playwright and `@axe-core/playwright` (install them in a scratch folder, not in the repo):

- Every page you touched, in dark and light color schemes: axe reports no violations, there are no page errors, and `document.documentElement.scrollWidth <= innerWidth` at 1280px and 360px wide.
- Hub docks: clicking each rail button shows the matching view and only one frame (the rail selection and the content must match after fast switching and after a reload).
- The feature itself, with real data from the demo app (for example `/examples/<area>`).

Exclude the launcher (`#ng-devtools-popup-root`) from axe runs on demo pages; it is checked through the panel.

## 4. Report honestly

Say which checks ran and their results. If something was skipped (no browser, no build), say so.
